InvDev Coding Test - Station Search

This is a badly written application which follows none of the practices we would look for in a Dev.
During an interview we can get a dev to either describe changes they would make or even do some of the changes.

TODO before using sample:
* Change front end to be either JS framework/library agnostic or to be AngularJS based

Tasks:
* Performance concerns
* Clean code!
* Test: The unit test is not testing the method which is used by the app
* DI
* Implement repository pattern
* Improve backend logic
* Improve UI
* Improve testing (TDD/BDD, backend/frontend)
* Replace hard-coded data source with DB
* Make it production ready

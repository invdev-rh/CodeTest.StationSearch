InvDev Coding Test - Station Search

This is a badly written application which follows none of the practices we would look for in a Dev.
A candidate should either describe changes they would make or even do some of the changes.

Areas to consider:
* Clean code!
* DI
* Data storage and patterns
* Backend code structure and logic
* Frontend code structure
* Unit testing (TDD/BDD)
* Performance concerns
* Identify needed changes to make it production ready
